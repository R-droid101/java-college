// Write a java program to create a class called TotalGoalsScored that
// represents the total number of goals scored by a football team. The
// TotalGoalsScored class should contain a single integer as instance data,
// representing the number of goals scored. Write a constructor to initialize
// the number of goals to zero. Write a method called setGoal that increments
// the value by one whenever a goal is scored, and another method called
// getGoal that returns the total number of goals scored so far. Finally, create
// a driver class called GoalTracker that creates a few TotalGoalsScored
// objects and tests their methods.
